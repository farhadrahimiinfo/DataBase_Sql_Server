The following example uses @@FETCH_STATUS to control cursor activities in a WHILE loop.

DECLARE @EmployeeID as NVARCHAR(256)
DECLARE @Title as NVARCHAR(50)

DECLARE Employee_Cursor CURSOR FOR  
SELECT LoginID, JobTitle   
FROM AdventureWorks2022.HumanResources.Employee  
WHERE JobTitle = 'Marketing Specialist';  
OPEN Employee_Cursor;  
FETCH NEXT FROM Employee_Cursor INTO @EmployeeID, @Title;  
WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0  
   BEGIN  
      Print '   ' + @EmployeeID + '      '+  @Title 
      FETCH NEXT FROM Employee_Cursor INTO @EmployeeID, @Title;  
   END;  
CLOSE Employee_Cursor;  
DEALLOCATE Employee_Cursor;  
GO

WHILE ( SELECT AVG(ListPrice) FROM dbo.DimProduct) < $300

    UPDATE dbo.DimProduct

    SELECT MAX ( ListPrice) FROM dbo.DimProduct  
    IF ( SELECT MAX (ListPrice) FROM dbo.DimProduct) > $500
